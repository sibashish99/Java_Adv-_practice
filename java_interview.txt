Objects:
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object .
An object has three characteristics:-
 State: represents the data (value) of an object.
 Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
 Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.
